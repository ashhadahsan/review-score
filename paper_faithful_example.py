    Title: "Attention Is All You Need: A Novel Approach to Neural Machine Translation"
    
    Abstract:
    We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms,
    dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks
    show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
    less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task,
    improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU points.
    
    Introduction:
    Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent neural networks in particular,
    have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction
    problems such as language modeling and machine translation. Numerous efforts have since continued to
    push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures.
    
    Methodology:
    The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise,
    fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The encoder maps an input sequence of
    symbol representations to a sequence of continuous representations. Given this representation,
    the decoder then generates an output sequence of symbols one element at a time.
    
    Results:
    On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big))
    outperforms the best previously reported models including ensembles by more than 2 BLEU points,
    establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French
    translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8.

    This paper presents an interesting approach to neural machine translation. However, I have several
    concerns about the experimental setup and the claims made.
    
    The authors claim that their method achieves 28.4 BLEU on English-to-German translation, but
    I'm not convinced this is a significant improvement over existing methods. The experimental
    section lacks proper comparison with recent work.
    
    Additionally, the paper doesn't adequately address the computational complexity of the attention
    mechanism. How does the training time compare to traditional RNN-based approaches?
    
    The theoretical analysis is also lacking. The authors don't provide sufficient mathematical
    justification for why attention mechanisms should work better than recurrent architectures.
